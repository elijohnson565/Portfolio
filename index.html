                 <p>My name is Elijah Johnson and I am a 23 year old aspiring full stack web developer. 
                     Ive had a passion for coding since I was 16 and have been mostly self taught. I started learning as much as I could over a couple years from youtube and forums, and then began making video games. I finished and released two before I 
                     realized that it wasn't a realistic career option for me at the time. Instead my attention focused on web development. 
                     I stopped maing video games and signed up for a 6 month full stack web development course through UC Davis. 
                     I am working on completeing the bootcamp now and have already created some websites that I want to share. Below is a collection of the projects that I have finished, and there will be many more to come!</p>

I mostly worked on the back-end, setting up routes and fixing bugs as we went. cmnt. is a simple forum type website where users can make an account, post topics or questions that they find interesting, and comment on other peoples topics with their opinions and ideas.</p>
